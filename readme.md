## Simple neural networks library in pure Python. 

Automatic differentiation, general expression graphs and more. 

Obviously the project is just a fun experiment and is about 30 times slower than TensorFlow, but still you can create simple neural networks. For example run:

    python example_rnn.py
    
to train a character-level recurrent net on Harry Potter book. The script will print text samples generated by the network every 100 iterations.
